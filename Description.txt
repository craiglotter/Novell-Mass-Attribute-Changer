Novell Mass Attribute Changer

Novell Mass Attribute Changer allows for the modifying of attributes for multiple objects at a time. The user can select from three actions (ADD, REPLACE, DELETE) as well as the new attribute value to apply.

Objects to be affected are selected by using a simple search query on the  objects contained on the Novell Network Tree of the University of Cape Town (UCT) network via LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) calls.
